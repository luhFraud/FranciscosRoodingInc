                        <h2>Re-Roofing</h2>
                        <p>Re-roofing is an alternative to completely removing and
                             replacing a roof. During re-roofing,
                              a new shingle overlay is placed over your worn
                               shingles. Francisco's Roofing Inc makes re-roofing
                                cost-effective by helping the client save on
                                 material and labor cost. With Francisco's
                                  Roofing Inc we can restore your roof's appearance
                                   and provide a new protective layer to help
                                    prevent leaks from getting inside your home.</p>

                        <h2>Roof coating</h2>
                        <p>Roof coatings add more benefits to your roof. 
                            A roof with a white or reflective coating will help
                             keep the building cooler by reducing temperatures
                              within the building and reducing energy consumptions
                               from air conditioning. Adding a roof coating will
                                also give your roof an extra layer of protection
                                 from leaks. With the expertise of Francisco's
                                  Roofing Inc we can help you choose a coating
                                   and help extend the life of your roof.</p>

                                <p>Needed to replace our entire roof. Found Francisco's Roofing on facebook.
                                     From day one father and son were professional and responsible.
                                      After contacting so many they were fast on setting up and estimate. 
                                      Turn around time was better than expected. Loved that they cleaned up 
                                      around the house after every work day. All staff members were friendly
                                       and professional. Would recommend them hands down.
                                        They are experienced don't let the new business scare you.
                                         Thank you Francisco Sr. & Jr.</p>

                                  and efficient. The price was very reasonable and they did a great job.

                               <p>We called Francisco for an estimate for a balcony that leaked.
                                 They did a thorough inspection and gave a very fair estimate.
                                  The crew did an excellent job were friendly and cleaned
                                   up as if they'd never been here. But here's the kicker—I didn't
                                    like the color of the finishing coat and Francisco ordered another
                                     color even though it extended the job another 2 weeks.
                                      When these guys say they want you to be happy they mean it. 
                                      You cannot do better than Francisco's.
